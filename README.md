## Description of the problem

A Reimann Sum is a certain kind of approximation of an integral by a finite sum. You can find more about it [here]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum/ ). In this project, we create an intuitive UI that approximates an definite integral for different functions.
